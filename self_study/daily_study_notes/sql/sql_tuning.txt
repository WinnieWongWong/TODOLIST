SQL Tuning:

1. Create INDEX

		Create INDEX index_name
		on table_name (c1 , c2 ,..);
		
   - !!!Identify which column frequently for query, then create index for these columns!!!
   
   - To show which tables have created index:
   
        SELECT TABLE_NAME, INDEX_NAME, COLUMN_NAME
		FROM information_schema.STATISTICS
		WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'scheme';
		
   - To show a table which column has created index:
   
	 SHOW INDEX FROM act_audit_attachment;
