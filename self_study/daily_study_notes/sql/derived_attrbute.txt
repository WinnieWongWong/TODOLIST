Derived attribute 
 
It is a calculation from other column in a table.

如果設計student table , 年齡應該用什麼儲

1. 今年幾歲 (eg 12 , 15...)
2. Date of birth (eg 1997-08-05)

Answer:

	For age , it mush not store 10 ,20 , 30...
	It should be DATE_OF_BIRTH
	Because age will increase year by year.
	
roll_no   name       DOB
1         kartik     01.01.2003
2         yash       01.01.2004
3         aditya     12.12.2003

select round(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), '2003-01-01') / 365 , 0) as age from student;

What you learn :
1. design a table , you should consider what store in table.
2. datediff() 通常return 兩日子間日數 , then 除365 變多少年
